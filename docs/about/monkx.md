Monk is our autonomous AI DevOps agent. The AI/ML model for Monk has been trained to understand how to answer questions and suggest configurations that are relevant and correct to your deployment. This means you can ask it questions about the state of the deployment, like the CPU usage of an instance, or prompt it to mutate the environment in a specific way. Our agent does not automatically deploy: all changes can be reviewed by you and your team before proceeding to a pipeline or production.
