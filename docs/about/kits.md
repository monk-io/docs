## Kits - Monk Packages

Kits are pre-packaged components such as containers, infrastructure elements, and compositions. We call them monkKits or just kits. There are hundreds of public Kits available in Monk Hub. 

These kits range from components like WordPress or PostgreSQL databases to infrastructure elements like CloudSQL, API endpoints or Firebase Cloud Functions. Kits can also form compositions. We call them “bundles” in GUI or “groups” in the CLI. These can be compositions like Kafka clusters or GitLab or combinations of other packages into full applications. Kit repositories can be either public or private.
