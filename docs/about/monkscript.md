title: monkScript
---

monkScript functions as the definition language for Kits, essentially utilizing YAML to articulate and structure Kits. 
One of our design goals was to make YAML manageable and eliminate the need for pre-processing using external tools. monkScript is easy to understand as it takes inspiration from well-known products like docker-compose. At the same time, monkScript is more expressive than similar definition languages thanks to inline scripting and composability.
