# Monk ecosystem at glance

[**monkOS**](/about/monkos.md): new, self-contained distributed cloud OS. 

[**monk Kits or “kits”**](/about/kits.md):  Abstractions for any infrastructure element. This can include a containerized application or microservice, or even an artifact like an AWS RDS / GCP database instance. Kits can also be bundled into other kits.

[**monkScript**](/about/monkscript.md): composable YAML for describing workloads and infrastructure in one place. A difference between *monkScript* and other YAML based Infrastructure-As-Code (IaaS) languages is that there is no need for macros or pre-processors. 

[**Whiteboard**](/about/whiteboard.md): Monk’s GUI. You can design your infrastructure from pre-packaged Kits and your own services. The design on the whiteboard is fully deployable which means you can deploy it on any cloud. 

[**Monk X**](/about/monkx.md): is an autonomous AI DevOps agent that runs your app in the cloud.
