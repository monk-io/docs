# Monk Privacy

Rather than direct you to a long, boring privacy policy, we'd like to take a moment to explain why we need to collect a tiny bit of personal information from you when creating a Monk account.

## Basic Account Details

Every Monk user is assigned a unique identifier tied to the email address used to create the account. This is primarily used for licensing purposes so that Monk knows what features to activate. Sign in occurs on the operator's computer, while the peers receive JWT tokens from the CLI. Your email and password aren't sent to the peers.

## Telemetry

Each monkd instance periodically sends telemetry signals to our servers to help us build metrics and examine common usage patterns. It contains the user ID, a self-signed cluster ID, and peer ID. No location or other identifying information is transmitted to us.

## Our Privacy Policy

Your data, code, and infrastructure are yours and Monk helps it stay that way. It's really that simple.

Now that the basics are out of the way, you can always [read the full policy](https://monk.io/privacy-policy).
