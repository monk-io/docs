# Monk Accounts & Authentication

You need an account in order to use Monk. Getting one is free, straightforward, and it shouldn't take more than a couple of seconds.

---

## Register Using CLI

You are going to need a working Monk installation before proceeding. If you haven't installed Monk yet, see [Getting Monk](get-monk).

## Register

To sign up for a new Monk account, run:

    monk register

You will be asked for:

-   email address
-   new password
-   password confirmation

You will be asked to verify your email address before logging in. Check your email!

:::warning

Choose a strong password to secure your Monk account. We recommend passwords longer than 12 characters.

## Log In

While using Monk tools, you will be asked to log in while performing various actions. In order to log in permanently, do the following:

    monk login

You will be asked for:

-   the email address you used to register
-   the password you chose when registering

## Log Out

If your work with the CLI is finished you might choose to log out. Here is how:

    monk logout

## Forgotten Password?

To reset your password, you can use the following command:

    monk reset

If you've been following along, you now have a working Monk installation. See these first steps in context in the next section: [Monk in 10 minutes](monk-in-10.md).
