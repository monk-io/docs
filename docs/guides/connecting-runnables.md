Getting services up and running isn't everything - they also need to talk to each other in order to serve their purpose. Monk abstracts away the complexity of networking and service discovery by introducing simple MonkScript operators that take care of finding services for you.

## The consumer

Consider the following template:

=== "mystuff.yaml"

    ```yaml linenums="1"
    namespace: mystuff

    my-service:
        defines: runnable
        containers:
            defines: containers
            my-service:
                image: ubuntu:latest
                environment:
                    - <- `DB_ADDR=${db-addr}`
                    - <- `DB_PORT=${db-port}`
                entrypoint: 'echo "db at ${DB_ADDR}:${DB_PORT}" ; sleep 3600'
        variables:
            defines: variables
            db-addr:
                type: string
                value: localhost
            db-port:
                type: int
                value: 21721
    ```

Let's assume that the `ubuntu:latest` image expects environment variables `DB_ADDR` and `DB_PORT` to be set. We are setting those environment variables based on control plane variables `db-addr` and `db-port`.

Whenever we run `mystuff/my-service` it will assume that the database is at `localhost:21721`. Though, in most cases, the database will not be at localhostand running this template as it is will end in an error.
The provider

`mystuff/my-service `expects a MongoDB database. Monk provides a template for this. So we don't really need to define it here. It's on the Hub.

Run MongoDB with:

    monk run mongodb/latest

## The connector

Before running mystuff/my-service we need to tell it where to find the database that is currently running. We will do that by replacing localhost with:

```clojure
<- get-hostname("mongodb/latest", "database")
```

`get-hostname` finds and returns the hostname of the target container. It takes two arguments:

1.  The path of the target runnable and,
2.  the name of the container within that runnable.

The template should now look like this:

=== "mystuff.yaml"

    ```yaml linenums="1"
    namespace: mystuff

    my-service:
        defines: runnable
        containers:
            defines: containers
            my-service:
                image: ubuntu:latest
                environment:
                    - <- `DB_ADDR=${db-addr}`
                    - <- `DB_PORT=${db-port}`
                entrypoint: 'echo "db at ${DB_ADDR}:${DB_PORT}" ; sleep 3600'
        variables:
            defines: variables
            db-addr:
                type: string
                value: <- get-hostname("mongodb/latest", "database")
            db-port:
                type: int
                value: 21721
    ```

## The result

Run the new template with:

    monk load mystuff.yaml
    monk run mystuff/my-service

It will automatically find MongoDB that we run earlier. It will also work if you decide to run both runnables as a group:

=== "mygroup.yaml"

    ```yaml linenums="1"
    my-group:
        defines: process-group
        runnable-list:
            - mongodb/latest
            - mystuff/my-service
    ```

    monk load mygroup.yaml
    monk run mystuff/my-group
