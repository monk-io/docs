# Kit Creation

Monk Kits published on [monkhub.io](https://monkhub.io) are constantly ranked by their usage. The more people install and run your Kit, the higher it gets in the ranking. 

Publishers of the most popular Kits are rewarded with money each month! (Even more than once!)

## Kit Ranking and Rewards 

All Kits on [monkhub.io](https://monkhub.io) are being constantly ranked by popularity which is a function of number of deployments and their aggregate runtime at large.

:::caution MonkOS Inc. reserves right to adjust the ranking

Kit Ranking is all about fair play. We slash Kits that appear to be unfairly boosted and ban their publishers from competing for rewards.

Additionally, the reward will be witheld if the total aggregate runtime of a Kit is shorter than certain threshold.

:::

Top 20 Kits are selected at the end of each month and their creators are automatically awarded an amount according to the table below.
