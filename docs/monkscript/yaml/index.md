Monk uses YAML to express templates. One of our design goals was to make YAML manageable and eliminate the need for pre-processing using external tools. In order to achieve succinct definitions and composability, we've defined three special keys on top of standard YAML: `namespace`, `defines` and `inherits`.

Additionally, Monk provides a `<-` macro that denotes an [Arrow script](/monkscript/scripting-index) which can be used in place of _any_ value in YAML.

It's important to understand how they work before working with MonkScript in order to avoid confusion.

## Namespaces

Each MonkScript YAML file has to have `namespace` key as the first key in the file. This instructs the MonkScript loader to put the contents of the template under a chosen path in Monk internal database.

Consider the following example:

```yaml linenums="1"
namespace: hello-world

foo: ...

bar: ...
```

Loading this snippet will put both `foo` and `bar` under `/hello-world` so that they can be later referred to as:

-   `foo` --> `hello-world/foo`
-   `bar` --> `hello-world/bar`

## Arrow scripts

Consider the following example:

```yaml linenums="1"
quux:
    bar: <- local-ip concat(":8080")
```

This arrow script will put a local IP address with a `:8080` postfix into `bar`. Resolution of this script happens dynamically at template _runtime_. Final result would be as if the template looked like this:

```yaml linenums="1"
quux:
    bar: 127.0.0.1:8080
```

## Inheritance

The most powerful feature of MonkScript is the ability to inherit any piece of YAML from any place in any definition. The inheritance mechanism practically eliminates the need for macro processing as it is capable of expressing many complex patterns by itself.

Consider the following example:

```yaml linenums="1"
foo:
    bar: 1
    baz: 2
    foos:
        - A
        - B
        - C

quux:
    inherits: ./foo ### let quux inherit foo
    baz: 3
    fnord:
        food: pizza
```

To Monk, `quux` is as if it was written in the following way:

```yaml linenums="1"
quux:
    bar: 1
    baz: 3
    foos:
        - A
        - B
        - C
    fnord:
        food: pizza
```

The `inherits` property can be used freely in any place in any definition and it can point to any path in any namespace known by Monk.

Inheritance can be used to:

-   Override any value in any template,
-   Compose a complex definition out of simple ones,
-   Re-use common definitions across multiple components,
-   Create multiple flavors or versions of the same runnable easily.

## Definitions

Consider the following definitions:

```yaml linenums="1"
foo:
    defines: runnable
    containers:
        defines: containers
        ...
bar:
    defines: runnable
    fun-boxes:
        defines: containers
```

Both `foo` and `bar` are [`runnable`](#runnable). The key defines has special meaning, it labels its parent node with a _descriptor_ (in this case, `runnable`). Monk finds relevant sections by looking at those descriptors.

By not deciding the meaning based on names, MonkScript allows for custom naming of all "special" sections. Notice that `foo` has `containers` but `bar` has `fun-boxes`. Both `containers` and `fun-boxes` has the same meaning to Monk as only the descriptor matters.

Not relying on key names allows MonkScript to be extended with every new release without affecting the existing templates.

!!! info

    Be sure to remember about assigning proper descriptors to the relevant sections as Monk will not interpret them without it.

Currently Monk recognizes several "special" sections, or definition classes higlighted below.

### `runnable`

Runnables are the basic unit in Monk. A `runnable` is essentially something that Monk can run, manage and then stop. This can be viewed as one or more containers meant to be standing together, plus associated resource definitions, variables etc.

### `process-group`

Groups (or `process-group`s) are compositions of multiple [runnables](#runnable) and other `groups` plus associated resources and state. This construct is used to compose other templates in Monk.

### `service`

Services are like [runnables](#runnable) but don't define containers. They can be used to represent services external to Monk which can't be managed directly.
