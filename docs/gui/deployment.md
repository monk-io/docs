title: Deploying Your Project
---

Once your design has been set up it is time to **Deploy** it onto your cloud account. The process is fully automated and only requires pressing a button.

Make sure that the kits are connected and placed appropriately and click the **Deploy** button on the top-right of the screen.

Kits turn gray indicating that they are not yet deployed. On the right side of the screen there is a deployment checklist that shows deployment tasks in real time as they progress.

During a successful deployment kits will turn green one by one indicating that they started without issues. In case some kits didnâ€™t start they will turn red. Kits can also become yellow indicating a warning. Hovering over a red or yellow kit reveals a list of problems.
