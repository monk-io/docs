Monk GUI is a graphical interface to monkOS. 

Every modern app starts with a whiteboard and system design diagram. With our GUI, called Monk Whiteboard, you can whiteboard directly to the cloud. It’s a low code tool that you can use to run applications on the cloud.  

## Accessing the Whiteboard

You can access the whiteboard by going to [https://monk.io](https://monk.io) and clicking on the [**Sign up** button](https://app.monk.io/register).

## Key Concepts 

**Monk X**: our AI DevOps agent, operates the whiteboard. The chatbot UI is just its exterior surface. It’s an autonomous agent that is system-aware and can design, advise, improve, and execute your deployable  diagram both before and after you deploy it. Monk X is currently, invite only. In order to have early access, sign up for one of our training sessions, which include workshops and Lunch & Learns. 

**Kits**: Kits are abstractions of infrastructure elements, including microservices. Kits are displayed on the whiteboard as boxes. Before a design is deployed, the boxes are grey, and after a deployment the boxes turn green or red to indicate if the deployment was successful.

**Arrow**: Arrows are used to connect infrastructure elements together, such as instances, load balancers, persistent storage, and so forth. When you connect two elements, either on the same cloud platform or across different cloud platforms, the connections are secure by default.

**Instances**: Instances are traditional cloud instances, e.g. an AWS EC2 instance. The instances are represented as clear rectangles on the board. In order to run a kit on an instance, you can drag and drop one or more kits into that instance's rectangle. 

**Deployable Diagrams**: Deployable diagrams are designed to be virtually identical to the way you would draw an architecture diagram, with the primary difference being that the Monk tools know how to do a secure deployment from that diagram.

**Deploy button**: it enables you to instantly deploy your diagram directly to any single or multi-cloud, public or private cloud.
