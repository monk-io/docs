title: Adding Your Own Services
---

A PostgreSQL database is not that useful by itself. With Monk you can add your services straight from GitHub - Monk converts your app into a private Kit and takes care of building it for you using Buildpacks. If you already have an app running on Heroku, Railway or other PaaS providers you can spin it up with Monk by just adding your existing repo.

A dialog will appear prompting you to select a repo. Since there are no existing connections you need to add one. Click **Connect** next to **GitHub**.

Now **Kit Browser** will display all your private kits under **All Kits** in **PRIVATE** section. They will also appear in searches when using the search bar. Select your app in the same way as any other kit and click **\+ Import** to place it on the board.

Monk will rebuild your services and deploy changes whenever you push to master branch in your repos that were imported.

Place your app inside the empty instance so that it doesnâ€™t clash with the **db**. With two kits on the board you are ready to connect them.
