# Guides

Ready to learn all about using Monk? In this section you'll find several guides explaining how you can achieve the most critical deployment tasks using nothing but Monk's YAML and CLI.

---

## Getting started

All guides assume that you already have a working Monk setup on your machine. If you don't have Monk installed yet see the [installation guide](../get-monk.md) for details, or [Monk in 10 minutes](../monk-in-10.md) for more context.

## Basics

Get familiar with Monk by learning simple scenarios for common taks you'll encounter in your setup and day to day:

: [Running Kits locally](running-templates.md): test deployments on your machine
: [Creating a cluster](/lifecycle/cluster-create-1): create and deploy p2p clusters on GCP and AWS
: [Running Kits in a cluster](running-templates-cluster): run single `runnable` and `group` Kits

## Tutorials

Tutorials are more involved guides taking you through the process of creating a concrete piece of infrastructure with Monk. Follow these to learn more about ways to work with Monk.
